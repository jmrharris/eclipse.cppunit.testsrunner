Ensure you have installed the official Eclipse CDT \"C/C++ Unit Testing Support\" plugin.\r\n\r\n1. In the Eclipse \"Project Explorer\" right-click your C/C++ Project and select \"Run As\"->\"Run Configurations...\"\r\n\r\n1. Select the \"C/C++ Unit\" item from the tree view.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new \"C/C++ Unit\" launch configuration for your project.\r\n\r\n1. In the \"C/C++ Unit Testing\" tab, choose \"CppUnit Tests Runner\" from \"Test Runner\" drop down menu.\r\n\r\n1. Select \"Apply\" apply and then \"Run\"\r\n\r\n1. Your CppUnit XML Test Report results will now appear in the Eclipse \"C/C++ Unit\" view.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\n1. Eclipse passes your test application's standard output to the CppUnit TestsRunner plugin.\r\n\r\n1. The plugin filters the output until it finds the character sequence '<', '?', 'x', 'm', 'l'.\r\n\r\n1. The plugin then treats the remaining test application output as a CppUnit default XML Test Report.\r\n\r\n1. The plugin adds each test result contained in the CppUnit XML Test Report to the \"C/C++ Unit\" view.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
